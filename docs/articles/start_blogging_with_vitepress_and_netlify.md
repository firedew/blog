# Start blogging with VitePress and Netlify

For a while now I had been toying with the idea that I should start writing down the stuff I find and learn. As I 
grew in experience as a Software Engineer I found myself repeating things over and over. I heard myself thinking "I 
just explained this to someone else the other day". So I figured, if I write it down and host that somewhere then I 
can just share the link next time. And, who knows, perhaps someone searching the web will stumble upon it and find 
it useful.

But where to begin? How do you start a blog as a webdeveloper these days?

So I began investigating and found that there are a lot of articles describing how to start a blog for non-developers. 
But being a web developer myself I like things to be a bit more tech savvy. It gives me the option to fully 
customize the blog to my own needs and ideas. On the other hand it does also mean that I will be spending a significant 
time developing the blog itself besides writing content.

After some internal debates with myself I decided that the benefits of control over the Blog 
outweighed the time spent developing. Especially since the time spent developing is a lot of fun!

## Why VitePress

[VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) is awesome. That's why.

Well, Vite is awesome. VitePress may still be a bit too clean for a feature demanding project like a blog. Where I 
will want things like comments or other forms of feedback from my readers.

In the JSWorld conference I saw a talk about Astro. It's built on Vite and looks like it already contains features 
that I want such as options for own components but also .mdx file support.

So, I'm hopping over for now. Brb with the results!
