## Beginner blogger

So I decided to create a blog. But where to start?

In the end I went with:
* Astro with Tailwind and Vue for development
* Markdown for content
* Netlify for hosting

For a full working example just head over to the source code of this blog [on Github](https://github.com/firedew/blog).

### Why Astro?
I first heard about [Astro](https://astro.build/) at the JSWorld conference in Amsterdam on february 8th 2023, and
was immediately intrigued. As a huge fan of [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) this framework simply fit my needs right
away.

Astro a modern static site builder that allows you to create fast, lightweight, and responsive websites. It provides
developers with a simple, intuitive way to build static sites with dynamic features. Astro makes it easy to create
static sites that look and feel like dynamic web applications.

One of the best things about Astro is that it's designed specifically for developers. It allows you to use familiar
tools and workflows, like Vue components, Tailwind css and npm packages to build your site. This makes it easy to
create custom designs, layouts, and features that are tailored to your specific needs.

### Why Markdown?
Ever tried creating a content heavy page using plain HTML? It quickly becomes very verbose and tough to edit as you
are writing and editing longer pieces of text. This is where Markdown comes into play.

It enables easier content creation which will eventually end up as HTML for the browser. It basically enables you to
spend all your cognitive effort into text and editing rather than markup and style.

### Why Netlify?
Moving your site from development to production can be done in so many ways. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is
a developer friendly hosting platform. It hooks
straight into the flow of git based repositories that developers are so familiar with. For each PR it can create
staged deployments, and it will automatically deploy anything in the default branch (main).

## The journey
Although I use very straight forward and already established tools out there I did run into some issues along the
way. Below are some of the issues I ran into and some tips for other who may be going through a similar process.

### Follow the tutorial on Astro docs
Astro has a [very good tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) on their site that walks you
through the various options gets you familiar with the
Astro way of working. Incidentally the tutorial was about creating a Blog :)

## Add MDX support
Shortly after beginning with Astro I decided I would probably prefer to use markdown files as my pages will be heavy
on content. Also I am likely to want custom components within Markdown, so I went straight ahead to MDX. Adding support
for it in Astro was super easy and worked right away. At this point I also noticed the large amount of plugins for
Astro.

## Styling with Tailwind
Although I'm still not 100% convinced of Tailwind I did in the end stick with it. I find that it gets verbose in
classnames and re-usability heavily relies on shared components which is not always as DX friendly as I would like.
Nevertheless, the kick-start that Tailwind provides simply outweighs any downsides so far.

There was [an Astro boilerplate project](https://creativedesignsguru.com/demo/astro-boilerplate/) that convinced me
in the end where I saw a good configuration using Tailwind in combination with Markdown. This boilerplate uses React
however and I have a strong preference for Vue so I grabbed the good stuff from there and used that in my own blog.
If you like React however (or are simply not opinionated yet) then this boilerplate probably meets your needs right
away!

## Issues with Webstorm
Somewhere during my career I started using Webstorm as an IDE, and now I'm hooked. I like this IDE very much and I
know it well so my speed in development is optimal in this IDE. Later Visual Code came along and is crazy
popular, but I haven't been able to adopt it.

Webstorm only recently added support for Astro (actually during the creation of this blog) in version
[2023.1](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/?utm_source=product&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=WS&utm_content=2023.1)


There was one issue where in local dev mode the Astro filewatcher would go off on any change in the .idea folder.
As this folder is IDE specific it's unnecessary for the watcher to respond to these changes. After a little bit of
Googling I found a suggestion to turn this off in the `vite.server.watch.ignored` configuration.

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    server: {
      watch: {
        ignored: ['**/.idea/*']
      }
    }
  }
})
```
